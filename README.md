# About the project
A personal project made with react js and firebase, with a heavy inspiration from WhatsApp Web the objective was to create a realtime chat, using firebase as the database of the app. Inside of the web you will need to sign in with your google account, after that you will find yourself with only one chat (the public-room), there you can chat with everyone else that created an account like you.
